## Disclaimer

This is for educational purposes only blah blah blah, I don't condone breaking discord's TOS or karuta's, it is not my fault if you get banned from karuta or discord.

Also dont be that guy who clones this repo and then updates config.json with his token which basically gives anyone access to his account (yes someone did this)
